# MarchMadnessPredictor
This project is a machine learning classifier trained on about 5 full seasons of NCAA basketball data. It uses pandas to parse and trim data, and sklearn to build and train models. Predictions for 2020 March Madness will be pushed below once model is finalized and hyperparameters are fine-tuned.
